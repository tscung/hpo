            <td>Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia, is located on the west coast of Peninsula of Malaysia. KL, as it is affectionately known, 
				was originally a mining settlement in the late 1800s where tin was discovered at the confluence of the Klang and Gombak rivers. 
				Although KL’s tin trade has declined since, the prosperity of the city has continued to grow. Today, KL is home to 1.5 million 
				people within the city proper, and more than 6 million in the surrounding metropolitan area.   As the political and cultural centre 
				of the nation, KL leads Malaysia’s fast-paced development in trade and commerce, banking and finance, manufacturing, transportation, 
				information technology and tourism.<br>
              	<br>
              	As a tourist destination, KL is an amazing cultural melting pot.  There, you will wander through communities of Chinese, Malays, 
				South Indians, East Malaysian ethnic groups, Thais, Indonesians, Sikhs and a huge community of expats. Each community offers its 
				own festivals, food, music, art and fashion, while influencing each other's cultures. Visitors to the city will find its extremely 
				varied cuisine a treat to the taste buds and an adventure in itself! KL also has a lively nightlife scene and a fascinating art and 
				performance culture, which blends contemporary and traditional styles from many backgrounds. Another point of interest is the city’s 
				architecture, which seems somewhat eccentric and unique, from hundred year old mansions to awe-inspiring sky scrapers, and all within 
				metres of each other. Not to be missed is the Petronas Twin Towers at the heart of the city, one of the modern marvels of the world 
				and until recently, the tallest buildings in the World.  Above all else, KL is a shopping haven, offering everything from street side 
				trinkets to haute couture.<br>
              	<br>
              	The resulting kaleidoscope of cultures, costumes and cuisines is nothing short of a whirlwind for the senses - more intense here than 
				anywhere else in Malaysia.<br>

              	<span class="allheader">Kuala Lumpur International Airport</span><br>
              	<br>KL International Airport is surrounded by four main cities of Kuala Lumpur, Shah Alam, Seremban and Malacca. The airport
              is a catchment area and offers opportunities for a hive of business activities. Every effort has been made to create a homely
              airport with a serene environment combined with high technologies attractions. Nature and greenery are part of the airport in
              line with the “airport in the forest and forest in the airport” concept. The natural environment of the airport is transformed to
              functions and activities that continue to enhance nature. The abundant forest areas will be preserved and transformed into an
              environment park containing recreational facilities. KLIA was voted as the World’s Best Airport (15-25 million passengers per
              annum) for two consecutive years, in the 2005 AETRA awards and 2006 ACI-ASQ awards.<br>
