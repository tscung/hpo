			Get ready to <i>pump-up-the-volume</i> with F5 at <b>Maison</b> -- a gem in the heart of the city’ club scene.
			Artfully converted from a row of colonial heritage buildings, its décor and atmosphere is both sensitive to its heritage and yet
			generously fused with the modern and eccentric. Bare brick walls reminiscent of bygone warehouses are balanced by minimalist modern
			fixtures, while ethnic woven sofas are juxtaposed with majestic chandeliers –truly reflecting the heady mix of contrasts that defines
			the city of Kuala Lumpur.<br/><br/>
			Here you will dine on locally inspired cuisine while entertained by live performances. As always, the evening is F5’ opportunity to
			show our appreciation for your efforts and reward the top performers among our partners in Asia Pacific. Guests will be required to
			assemble shortly after the last breakout session of the day for a short bus ride to this party. Dress code – smart casual.<br/>
